Write an Alogorithm to check if number is prime or not.

steps : ----

for being prime the number must be divisible by 1 and itself only.

--> read num
--> initialize check = 0.
--> initialize loop variable i equals to n and run upto 1(excluding 1) and decrement value by 1 in each step.
--> under loop if num % n == 0 then check ++
--> after looping 
--> if check == 1 the prime else non prime
